# Git Commands Reference Guide

When working with Git, it's inevitable you'll have to work with the command line. This guide will help you with the most common commands you'll need to know. For more information on a specific command, you can use the `git help` command followed by the command you want to learn more about. For example, `git help commit`. There is also the [Git Guide](https://public-health-scotland.github.io/git-guide), which is a more in-depth guide to using Git in PHS, including a more complete list of commands.
