# Version Control

Version Control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. In PHS, we use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) as our version control system. Git is a distributed version control system that allows for the creation of branches, which are copies of the main codebase that can be worked on independently. This allows for multiple people to work on the same project at the same time without conflicting with each other. It also allows for the creation of a stable version of the codebase that can be used for production, while allowing for the development of new features in a separate branch.

In order to collaborate and share content, we use [GitHub](https://github.com/) as the primary platform for hosting our code, and [Gitea](https://phs-git.nhsnss.scot.nhs.uk/) as an internally hosted option. GitHub is a web-based hosting service for version control using Git. It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project.
