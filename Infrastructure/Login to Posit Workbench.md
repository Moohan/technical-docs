9. This will provide a popup with some options as shown below for how to set up your session:
    - The 'Session Name' can be left as the default or you can provide something more specific to identify. This could be useful if you require multiple sessions open at once.
    - The 'Editor' allows you to select an IDE (Integrated Development Environment): RStudio (default), Jupyter Lab, Jupyter Notebook, or VS Code.
    - 'Cluster' can only be Kubernetes
    - There is separate guidance for selecting a suitable session size here: [https://github.com/Public-Health-Scotland/R-Resources/blob/master/posit_workbench_and_kubernetes.md#best-practice]()

10. Once you are satisfied with the details entered on the 'New Session' screen, click the "Start Session" button.

12. Once the session has opened, read the prompt in the console pane, including the Acceptable Usage Policy, and follow the instructions.
