# Posit Team Applications - Contact Information

## Background

[Posit Team](https://posit.co/products/enterprise/team/) enterprise applications have been deployed for [Public Health Scotland (PHS)](https://publichealthscotland.scot/) on the [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/) cloud computing platform.

Posit Team comprises three applications:

* [Posit Workbench](https://posit.co/products/enterprise/workbench/) - provides access to all the development environments RStudio, Jupyter and VS Code for both R and Python;
* [Posit Package Manager](https://posit.co/products/enterprise/package-manager/) - a repository management server to organise and centralise R and Python packages across Public Health Scotland;
* [Posit Connect](https://posit.co/products/enterprise/connect/) - publish the things you create in both R & Python, including interactive applications, documents, notebooks, and dashboards. Deploy models as APIs, and configure reports to run on a custom schedule.

Please note that the deployment of Posit Connect for PHS is still in development.

## Purpose

This document aims to provide users of Posit Team applications with contact information for seeking support.

## Requesting a change to your Posit Workbench Kubernetes Profile

The Kubernetes Profile that a user's account is assigned to determines the maximum amount of CPU and/or Memory (RAM) that the user can request for a Posit Workbench session.

The form at [https://forms.office.com/e/VEutAJ8p9Y](https://forms.office.com/e/VEutAJ8p9Y) allows you to submit a request for a change to your Posit Workbench Kubernetes Profile, or a request on behalf of someone else.

Before submitting the request, please consult the guidance at https://github.com/Public-Health-Scotland/R-Resources/blob/master/posit_workbench_and_kubernetes.md for recommendations on how many CPUs and Memory are likely to be required.

Authorisation for the request is required from the person's line manager, and will be sought automatically via Microsoft Approvals in Microsoft Teams.  Once authorisation has been granted, a ServiceNow request can be opened, attaching the PDF authorisation generated by Microsoft Approvals to the request.

## All other types of support request

Public Health Scotland's Data Science team will be providing first-line support for Posit Team applications and will be triaging all queries and requests for support with Posit applications.

To raise an issue, report an incident, make a change request or ask a question about Posit Team applications, please complete the form at [https://forms.office.com/e/pqmmNMkhT6](https://forms.office.com/e/pqmmNMkhT6).

The team will respond to all queries and requests for support submitted via this form, and will always respond as quickly as possible.

Queries and requests for support with Posit applications cannot be made directly in Service Now by users, unless explicitly authorised by the Data Science team.

**Please do not raise a request or incident in Service Now unless requested to by a member of the Data Science team.**
